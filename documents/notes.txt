To Do Next: (Next Sprint):
- Graph function
- Table function (check java fx)
- Revamp GUI with JavaFX wrappers
- SQL databasing
- API Access to financial data

Database workflow:
- User inputs a stock
- Check if that stock exists in the database
- Check if the data that the user requests exists in the database
( need to check if data for time ranges is valid, as recent time ranges would not have been updated)
- Update the database if necessary
- Get the required data from the database
- Put into line chart and display linechart to user
